  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={We propose a renormalization group (RG) theory of eigen microstates, which are introduced in the statistical ensemble composed of microstates obtained from experiments or computer simulations. A microstate in the ensemble can be considered as a linear superposition of eigen microstates with probability amplitudes equal to their eigenvalues. Under the renormalization of a factor b, the largest eigenvalue σ1 has two trivial fixed points at low and high temperature limits and a critical fixed point with the RG relation, where β and ν are the critical exponents of order parameter and correlation length, respectively. With the Ising model in different dimensions, it has been demonstrated that the RG theory of eigen microstates is able to identify the critical point and to predict critical exponents and the universality class. Our theory can be used in research of critical phenomena both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems without considering the Hamiltonian, which is the foundation of Wilson's RG theory and is absent for most complex systems.},

  abstract={Tipping elements are components of the Earth system that may shift abruptly and irreversibly from one state to another at specific thresholds. It is not well understood to what degree tipping of one system can influence other regions or tipping elements. Here, we propose a climate network approach to analyse the global impacts of a prominent tipping element, the Amazon Rainforest Area (ARA). We find that the ARA exhibits strong correlations with regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and West Antarctic ice sheet. Models show that the identified teleconnection propagation path between the ARA and the TP is robust under climate change. In addition, we detect that TP snow cover extent has been losing stability since 2008. We further uncover that various climate extremes between the ARA and the TP are synchronized under climate change. Our framework highlights that tipping elements can be linked and also the potential predictability of cascading tipping dynamics.},

  abstract={The Tibetan Plateau (TP) and surrounding regions, vital to global energy and water cycles, are profoundly influenced by climate change and anthropogenic activities. Despite widespread attention to vegetation greening across the region since the 1980s, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study employs the eigen microstates method to quantify vegetation greening dynamics using long-term remote sensing and reanalysis data. We identify two dominant modes that collectively explain more than 61% of the vegetation dynamics. The strong seasonal heterogeneity in the southern TP, primarily driven by radiation and agricultural activities, is reflected in the first mode, which accounts for 46.34% of the variance. The second mode, which explains 15% of the variance, is closely linked to deep soil moisture (SM3, 28 cm to 1 m). Compared to precipitation and surface soil moisture (SM1 and SM2, 0–28 cm), our results show that deep soil moisture exerts a stronger and more immediate influence on vegetation growth, with a one-month response time. This study provides a complexity theory-based framework to quantify vegetation dynamics and underscores the critical influence of deep soil moisture on greening patterns in the TP.},

  title={Eigen microstates in self-organized criticality},
  abstract={We employ the eigen microstates approach to explore the self-organized criticality (SOC) in two celebrated sandpile models, namely the BTW model and the Manna model. In both models, phase transitions from the absorbing state to the critical state can be understood by the emergence of dominant eigen microstates with significantly increased weights. Spatial eigen microstates of avalanches can be uniformly characterized by a linear system size rescaling. The first temporal eigen microstates reveal scaling relations in both models. Furthermore, by finite-size scaling analysis of the first eigen microstates, we numerically estimate critical exponents. Our findings could provide profound insights into eigen microstates of the universality and phase transition in nonequilibrium complex systems governed by self-organized criticality.},

  abstract={Many biological processes employ mechanisms involving the locations and interactions of multiple components. Given that most biological processes occur in three dimensions, the simultaneous measurement of three-dimensional locations and interactions is necessary. However, the simultaneous three-dimensional precise localization and measurement of interactions in real time remains challenging. Here, we report a new microscopy technique to localize two spectrally distinct particles in three dimensions with an accuracy (2.35σ) of tens of nanometers with an exposure time of 100 ms and to measure their real-time interactions using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) simultaneously. Using this microscope, we tracked two distinct vesicles containing t-SNAREs or v-SNARE in three dimensions and observed FRET simultaneously during single-vesicle fusion in real time, revealing the nanoscale motion and interactions of single vesicles in vesicle fusion. Thus, this study demonstrates that our microscope can provide detailed information about real-time three-dimensional nanoscale locations, motion, and interactions in biological processes.},

  abstract={In a statistical ensemble with M microstates, we introduce an M×M correlation matrix with correlations among microstates as its elements. Eigen microstates of ensemble can be defined using eigenvectors of the correlation matrix. The eigenvalue normalized by M represents weight factor in the ensemble of the corresponding eigen microstate. In the limit M → ∞, weight factors drop to zero in the ensemble without localization of the microstate. The finite limit of the weight factor when M → ∞ indicates a condensation of the corresponding eigen microstate. This finding indicates a transition into a new phase characterized by the condensed eigen microstate. We propose a finite-size scaling relation of weight factors near critical point, which can be used to identify the phase transition and its universality class of general complex systems. The condensation of eigen microstate and the finite-size scaling relation of weight factors are confirmed using Monte Carlo data of one-dimensional and two-dimensional Ising models.},
