I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Earth system at [Prof. Niklas Boersâ€™ lab](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/esm/home/) at technical university of Munich (TUM). Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. at the School of Complex Systems, Beijing Normal University (BNU), in Beijing, China. I also hold an M.Phil. in Biophysics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and a B.Sc. in Physics from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS).

My research passion lies in uncovering universal behaviors in complex systems and predicting how these systems respond to changing control parameters, such as phase transitions in physical systems or abrupt shifts in the Earth system. My work focuses on climate tipping points and teleconnections in the Earth system, critical phenomena in physics, and the dynamics of complex systems near criticality.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
